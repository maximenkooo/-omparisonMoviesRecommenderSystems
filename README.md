# Task

Needed to mplement the method from [article](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0511.pdf) and apply custom movie ratings
to datasets [movielens-20M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
It is necessary to compare this method with the [ImplicitALS](https://implicit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/als.html) method for the ndcg @ 1 and ndcg
@ 10 metrics. Could use its third-party implementation.

Was used the third [datset](https://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html)
